Traditionally, RockTomate jobs can be executed manually either [through API, UI or Command Line](../workflows/running-job.md).

Event Manager lets users configure RockTomate to listen certain in-editor events and execute jobs when certain events are invoked.

This allows you to not only automate tasks, but also day-to-day workflows. For example, Event Manager can be configured to setup newly imported textures based on their file names.

Some events also have parameter values which can be passed over to executing jobs as variables. You can also choose to not run jobs based on specified conditions.
