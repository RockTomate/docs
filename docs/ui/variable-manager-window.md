Variable Manager Window is used to manage variables of a currently open Job in [Job Editor Window](ui/job-editor-window.md).

The window splits variables by three tabs: Job, External and Root.

## Job

![](/assets/ui/variable-manager-window-tab-job.png)

Lists all variables created specifically for a Job. To add a new variable, press the + button at the top right corner.

## External

![](/assets/ui/variable-manager-window-tab-external.png)

Lists all [variable bank](variables/variable-banks.md) references.

## Root

![](/assets/ui/variable-manager-window-tab-root.png)

Lists all discovered [root variables](variables/root-variables.md). It also shows evaluated values for each where possible.

Right-clicking any variable gives you an option to copy it in `%VAR_NAME%` format.
