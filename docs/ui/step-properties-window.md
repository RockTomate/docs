Lists all properties of a Step. The view is split between Input and Output fields.

Unlike other RockTomate windows, this window is actually hosted within Unity's [Inspector Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html). Step Properties show up when step is selected. Selecting anything else (e.g. C# script in project window or GameObject in a Scene) will deselect the Step.

## Setting Notes

Step description is listed on top of the window. Along with that, you can set custom comments to the Step in the "Notes" field.

## Multiple Windows

You can edit multiple steps by adding another Inspector Window and locking an old one.
